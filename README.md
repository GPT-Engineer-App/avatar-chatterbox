# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: avatar-chatterbox 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: code snippet that demonstrates how to create a function that can be added to a WebRTC implementation to allow an avatar to call and interact with humans as an interviewer:

class AvatarInterviewer {
  constructor(webrtcConnection) {
    this.webrtcConnection = webrtcConnection;
    this.isCallActive = false;
    this.interviewQuestions = [
      "Tell me about your experience with JavaScript.",
      "How do you handle asynchronous operations in your code?",
      "What's your approach to debugging complex issues?",
      // Add more interview questions here
    ];
    this.currentQuestionIndex = 0;
  }

  startInterview() {
    if (!this.isCallActive) {
      this.isCallActive = true;
      this.initializeCall();
    } else {
      console.log("Interview is already in progress.");
    }
  }

  initializeCall() {
    // Set up WebRTC connection
    this.webrtcConnection.createOffer()
      .then(offer => this.webrtcConnection.setLocalDescription(offer))
      .then(() => {
        // Send offer to the interviewee (implementation depends on your signaling method)
        this.sendSignalingMessage({ type: 'offer', sdp: this.webrtcConnection.localDescription });
      })
      .catch(error => console.error("Error creating offer:", error));

    // Listen for ICE candidates





Natural Language Processing (NLP): Integrate a more sophisticated NLP library (e.g., TensorFlow.js with a pre-trained model, or an API like Google's Natural Language API) for better understanding of the interviewee's responses.

async processAnswer(answer) {
  const nlpResult = await this.performNLP(answer);
  // Use nlpResult for more accurate sentiment analysis and topic extraction
  // ...
}

async performNLP(text) {
  // Implement NLP processing here
  // This could involve calling an external API or using a local NLP library
}

Dynamic Question Generation: Instead of a fixed list of questions, implement an algorithm to dynamically generate questions based on the interviewee's previous answers and the flow of the conversation.

generateNextQuestion() {
  // Use the conversation history and NLP results to generate the next question
  // This could involve template-based generation or more advanced AI techniques
}

Emotion Recognition: If the avatar has access to the interviewee's video feed, you could implement facial emotion recognition to better gauge the interviewee's reactions.

analyzeVideoEmotion(videoTrack) {
  // Implement video-based emotion recognition
  // This could involve using a library like face-api.js
}

Adaptive Behavior: Make the avatar's behavior adapt to the interviewee's communication style and preferences.

updateAvatarBehavior() {
  // Adjust the avatar's speaking pace, tone, or question complexity
  // based on the interviewee's responses and detected emotions
}

Interview Analytics: Implement a system to analyze the overall interview performance and generate a summary report.

generateInterviewReport() {
  // Analyze the entire interview conversation
  // Generate insights, scores, or recommendations
}

Error Handling and Fallbacks: Improve the robustness of the system by adding more comprehensive error handling and fallback options.

handleError(error) {
  console.error("Error occurred:", error);
  // Implement appropriate fallback behavior
  // e.g., switch to text-based communication if audio fails
}

Accessibility Features: Add features to make the interview process more accessible, such as closed captions for the avatar's speech or alternative input methods for interviewees who can't use speech.

enableClosedCaptions() {
  // Implement real-time captioning for the avatar's speech
}

enableAlternativeInput() {
  // Allow for text input as an alternative to speech
}
    this.webrtcConnection.onicecandidate = event => {
      if (event.candidate) {
        // Send ICE candidate to the interviewee (implementation depends on your signaling method)
        this.sendSignalingMessage({ type: 'ice-candidate', candidate: event.candidate });
      }
    };

    // Handle incoming tracks (audio/video)
    this.webrtcConnection.ontrack = event => {
      // Handle incoming audio/video tracks (e.g., attach to video element)
      console.log("Received track:", event.track.kind);
    };

    // Set up data channel for text-based communication
    this.dataChannel = this.webrtcConnection.createDataChannel("interview");
    this.dataChannel.onopen = () => this.onDataChannelOpen();
    this.dataChannel.onmessage = event => this.onDataChannelMessage(event);
  }

  onDataChannelOpen() {
    console.log("Data channel opened. Starting interview...");
    this.askNextQuestion();
  }

  onDataChannelMessage(event) {

    console.log("Received answer:", message);
    // Process the answer (e.g., send to an AI for analysis)
    this.processAnswer(message);
  }

  askNextQuestion() {

      const question = this.interviewQuestions[this.currentQuestionIndex];

  }

    // Implement answer processing logic here (e.g., sentiment analysis, keyword extraction)
    console.log("Processing answer:", answer);
    
    // After processing, ask the next question

  }

  sendSignalingMessage(message) {
    // Implement your signaling logic here (e.g., WebSocket, REST API)
